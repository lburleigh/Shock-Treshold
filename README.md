# Shock-Treshold
Allows participants to determine intensity of shock using button responses

Once participants choose an "uncomfortable, but not painful" shock level, one more shock is given at a higher intensity to verify intensity.
When the proper intensity is achieved for the second time, the task ends.

Task is written in Matlab to deliver shock through Biopack STIMISOC.
Script communicates with DAQ system.
